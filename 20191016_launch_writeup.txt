Hello again people

I re-introduce to you a one-stop MP4 converter solution that can cleverly convert image sequences and movies files in one step!

Onto the same icon, you can drag single image from a sequence, and it creates an mp4 from the sequence.
If you drag a movie file (mov, avi, flv), it creates a mp4 for you.

Finally, if you drag in multiple files or even an entire folder that contains files of mixed types (images, movies), it will also do its thing (image seq -> mp4, mov -> mp4).

I think I can finally call it smart. :)

At the moment it will break if there are spaces / non-alpha numeric characters in the incoming file paths.

Give it a try! All you need to do is drop your file(s) / folder(s) on the aMp4Maker icon in the launcher tray.
